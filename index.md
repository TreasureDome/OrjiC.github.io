## 📊 Featured Projects

### [Project 1: Sales Analysis Dashboard]
This retail sales dashboard image provides a visually rich, data-driven scenario suitable for showcasing analytics and visualization skills in your portfolio. It represents a business intelligence solution designed for Zedro Mart, allowing stakeholders to monitor key retail metrics and uncover actionable insights.

Scenario Brief
Zedro Mart, a multisector retail business, needed a comprehensive dashboard to track and analyze its sales performance across various product categories and locations. The dashboard was developed to meet management's requirements for real-time visibility into revenue, transactions, category-based performance, discount usage, and payment methods trends.

Dashboard Purpose
Aggregate and display total revenue, transaction count, and average spend in a single view.

Segment sales data by product categories, location (In-Store vs. Online), and monthly trends.

Visualize the impact of category discounts and payment method preferences on customer behavior.

Support decision-making with actionable insights from item quantity sold, revenue fluctuations, and payment usage patterns.

Technical Implementation
Data was processed and visualized using modern BI tools (such as Power BI or Tableau), leveraging data cleaning and aggregation techniques suitable for retail transaction datasets.

Interactive filters allow users to slice data by location, category, and transaction date, supporting detailed exploration for business managers.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations, including bar charts and line graphs, offer immediate clarity on profitability, operational trends, and customer activity.

Business Impact
Enables management to identify high-performing categories and optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

Highlights seasonal and monthly trends in revenue to support forecasting and planning.

Assists in evaluating the effectiveness of promotional discount programs by category.

Reveals preferred payment methods and purchasing behavior, informing customer engagement initiatives.

Visual Reference
The dashboard presents total revenue of $1,552,071 across 12,575 transactions, with an average spend of $123.43 per customer. Revenue, transaction quantities, and discount statistics are segmented by category and location, complemented by trend analyses and payment insight charts for targeted decision support.
